# Practicing-Git
Practicing using Git.
Hi my name is Max. I'm a BA at Insurify.
I am originally from Wilmington, NC but now I live in Somerville, MA.
I am interested in learning more technical skills, including SQL, git, and github.
I have a BS in Mathematics and Religious Studies from UNC Chapel Hill.
I graduated in 2024.

I enjoy hiking, running, watercolor painting, reading philosophy, and travelling. 
My goals include hiking mount Shasta, contributing to the local community, supporting natural ecosystems, and writing a book.
